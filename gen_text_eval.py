One of them says \u201c7,497 is a prime number,\u201d while the other says, \u201c7,497 is not a prime number.\u201d In a case like this one, we would probably conclude that there can only be a single right answer. We might have a lot of respect for both participants in the conversation, we might agree that they are both very reasonable and conscientious, but all the same, one of them has got to be wrong. The question under discussion here, we might say, is perfectly objective.\n\nBut now suppose we switch to a different topic. Two people are talking about food. One of them says \u201cDon\u2019t even think about eating caterpillars! They are totally disgusting and not tasty at all,\u201d while the other says \u201cCaterpillars are a special delicacy \u2013 one of the tastiest, most delectable foods a person can ever have occasion to eat.\u201d In this second case, we might have a very different reaction. We might think that there isn\u2019t any single right answer. Maybe caterpillars are just tasty for some people but not for others. This latter question, we might think, should be understood as relative.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got at least a basic sense for these two categories, we can turn to a more controversial case. Suppose that the two people are talking about morality. One of them says \u201cThat action is deeply morally wrong,\u201d while the other is speaking about the very same action and says \u201cThat action is completely fine \u2013 not the slightest thing to worry about.\u201d In a case like this, one might wonder what reaction would be most appropriate. Should we say that there is a single right answer and anyone who says the opposite must be mistaken, or should we say that different answers could be right for different people? In other words, should we say that morality is something objective or something relative?\n\nThis is a tricky question, and it can be difficult to see how one might even begin to address it. Faced with an issue like this one, where exactly should we look for evidence?\n\nThough philosophers have pursued numerous approaches here, one of the most important and influential is to begin with certain facts about people\u2019s ordinary moral practices. The idea is that we can start out with facts about people\u2019s usual ways of thinking or talking and use these facts to get some insight into questions about the true nature of morality.\n\nThinkers who take this approach usually start out with the assumption that ordinary thought and talk about morality has an objectivist character. For example, the philosopher Michael Smith claims that\n\nwe seem to think moral questions have correct answers; that the correct answers are made correct by objective moral facts; that moral facts are wholly determined by circumstances and that, by engaging in moral conversation and argument, we can discover what these objective moral facts determined by the circumstances are.\n\nAnd Frank Jackson writes:\n\nI take it that it is part of current folk morality that convergence will or would occur. We have some kind of commitment to the idea that moral disagreements can be resolved by sufficient critical reflection \u2013 which is why we bother to engage in moral debate. To that extent, some sort of objectivism is part of current folk morality.\n\nThen, once one has in hand this claim about people\u2019s ordinary understanding, the aim is to use it as part of a complex argument for a broader philosophical conclusion. It is here that philosophical work on these issues really shines, with rigorous attention to conceptual distinctions and some truly ingenious arguments, objections and replies. There is just one snag. The trouble is that no real evidence is ever offered for the original assumption that ordinary moral thought and talk has this objective character. Instead, philosophers tend simply to assert that people\u2019s ordinary practice is objectivist and then begin arguing from there.\n\nIf we really want to go after these issues in a rigorous way, it seems that we should adopt a different approach. The first step is to engage in systematic empirical research to figure out how the ordinary practice actually works. Then, once we have the relevant data in hand, we can begin looking more deeply into the philosophical implications \u2013 secure in the knowledge that we are not just engaging in a philosophical fiction but rather looking into the philosophical implications of people\u2019s actual practices.\n\nJust in the past few years, experimental philosophers have been gathering a wealth of new data on these issues, and we now have at least the first glimmerings of a"
