They asked engineers what their biggest challenges were when developing DNN models for NLP tasks, and found that the biggest challenge was choosing from multiple frameworks, models and optimization techniques. This is because there are so many different options available, and it can be difficult to know which one to choose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "answers": ["By conducting a survey among engineers", "Unanswerable"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1692}
