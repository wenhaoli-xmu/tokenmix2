And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools?\nAnswer: Our understanding is developing about the virus and its impact on children and young people. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions. Part of the honest challenge is that we don't fully understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, but we do expect there will have been an impact.
