LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Police in riot gear closed in before dawn on Monday on anti-Wall Street activists in Los Angeles who defied a midnight deadline to vacate a camp outside City Hall, but stopped short of clearing the encampment. Four demonstrators were arrested during the brief confrontation, accused of being present at an unlawful assembly, before police ultimately pulled back from City Hall park. Later, attorneys for Occupy LA asked a federal judge for an injunction barring police from evicting the camp, arguing that Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and police chief Charlie Beck had violated their civil rights by ordering it dismantled. The Los Angeles encampment, which officials had tolerated for weeks even as other cities moved in to clear out similar camps, is among the largest on the West Coast aligned with a 2-month-old national Occupy Wall Street movement protesting economic inequality and excesses of the U.S. financial system. Villaraigosa eventually gave protesters until just after midnight to remove their tents and leave or face a forcible removal, setting the stage for the latest showdown between leaders of a major U.S. city and the Occupy movement. But about two hours after the eviction deadline had passed, police commanders said they would permit the Occupy LA encampment to stay until at least daybreak. Police Commander Andrew Smith later said he thought it was \"highly unlikely\" that the camp would be forced to shut down on Monday. Staking its place since October 1 on the grounds surrounding City Hall, the Los Angeles camp had grown to roughly 400 tents and 700 to 800 people, organizers and municipal officials said. At least a third of campers were believed to be homeless.

Police do, however, intend to clear protesters out of the street, and several people who refused to move out of an intersection have already been arrested. \"We definitely need to get morning traffic in,\" a police commander explained.

The trail was first conceived in 1921 by Arnold H. Hague, a conservationist and writer from San Francisco. He envisioned a trail that would stretch from the Mexican border to the Canadian border, connecting the Pacific coasts of Mexico, California, Oregon, and Washington.\n\nThe Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) was formed in 1968 to manage and protect the PCT. The association works to maintain the trail, promote the trail, and educate hikers about the trail.\n\nThe PCT has been popularized in recent years, especially due to the 2012 movie \"Wild\" starring Reese Witherspoon, which is based on the true story of Cheryl Strayed's solo hike on the PCT.\n\nThe PCTA has implemented a quota system for hiking permits, with a cap of 50 permits per day to spread out the number of hikers on the trail. This is due to environmental concerns and the financial impact of increased use on services.\n\nThe PCT is a popular destination for long-distance hikers, with over 3,000 people attempting the full thru-hike in 2016.\n\nHikers on the PCT are generally courteous and respectful of the trail environment, but some hikers have been observed to leave a negative impact on the trail.\n\nHikers on the PCT typically experience a sense of solitude, serenity, and connection with nature.\n\nHiking the PCT is a challenging but rewarding experience that requires preparation, planning, and a strong will.\n\nIn summary, the Pacific Crest Trail is a long-distance hiking trail that traverses the western United States, connecting the Pacific coasts of Mexico, California, Oregon, and Washington.

He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

Child-care centers in federal agencies would close, parents said, and child-care workers, who are not employed by the federal government, likewise would be sent home.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business.

A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged.

The 70-year-old Simpson, who was acquitted of murder charges in the deaths of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman, was found eligible for parole after a hearing in Lovelock, Nevada. Simpson, who has been described as a model prisoner at Lovelock Correctional Center, a medium-security prison in the Nevada desert, was granted parole on four of the nine charges, including kidnapping and assault with a deadly weapon. Simpson was sentenced to 33 years in prison in 2008, but he was eligible for parole after serving nine years. Simpson appeared calm and spoke softly as he addressed the parole board, saying he has taken two \"Alternative to Violence\" classes and that his case was a \"misunderstanding\" that he regrets. Simpson said he has been a \"peacemaker\" in prison and has been a model inmate. He said he has taken responsibility for his actions and has no plans to return to prison. Simpson's daughter, Arnelle Simpson, said her father was a \"best friend\" and \"rock\" and that he was \"sorry that things turned out the way they did.\" Simpson's attorney, Malcolm LaVergne, said Simpson's release was \"long overdue.\" Simpson will be released from Lovelock Correctional Center in October.\n\nThe hearing featured testimony from Arnelle Simpson, the former football great's oldest daughter, who said her father was \"my best friend and my rock.\" Simpson also said he has taken two \"Alternative to Violence\" classes, which he said was \"the most important course any person in this prison can take.\" Simpson also said he has taken responsibility for his actions and has no plans to return to prison.\n\nSimpson was sentenced to 33 years in prison in 2008, but he was eligible for parole after serving", "answers": ["OJ Simpson's big moment has arrived.

An extensive analysis of recent data showed that one in every seven colorectal cancer patients was younger than 50. The University of Michigan study raises questions about the current guidelines to begin screening at age 50. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Signs of colorectal cancer, often called the “symptomless cancer,” include anemia, a dramatic change in the size or frequency of bowel movements, and dark blood or blood mixed with stool, (sometimes appearing as black threads), in bowel movements. Because these symptoms may be nonexistent, mild, or infrequent, many people are not aware of their condition until their malignancy becomes advanced and spreads into the lymph nodes. A colonoscopy is the usual screening test, but stool tests are also effective for some people. If you are worried, you can request your primary care physician provide you with one of these simple stool tests, no matter your age.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The find is controversial, as a similar site in the Kimberley region of northwest Australia found a tiny axe fragment that is also dated to 49,000 years ago. However, the team insists the axe fragment is no more than 48,000 years old. The find is an important milestone in the debate over whether humans or climate change caused the extinction of megafauna.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

{"pred": "\n\n\nThe article discusses the findings of three new studies published in Science that challenge the previously held belief that modern behaviors such as symbolism, innovation and art only emerged during a \"human revolution\" around 40,000 to 50,000 years ago. The studies, led by Jayde Lee and Marta Mirazon Lahr, show that complex behaviors such as the use of obsidian and ochre pigments for toolmaking and artistic expression occurred much earlier than previously thought, around 320,000 years ago in the Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya. This occurred during a period of global climate change that led to the evolution of new technologies and cultural practices. The studies suggest that these behaviors arose in response to the effects of climate change on food sources and the need to adapt or go extinct. The researchers argue that complex behaviors and cognitive organization were present in hominin populations at this time, which indicates that modernity arose in Africa before migrating out of the continent. The studies highlight the importance of long-term, global environmental and climatic change in driving technological innovation and cultural evolution.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

Meanwhile, the DWSD has been shutting off water service aggressively for its delinquent residential customers. The DWSD executed 7,210 shut-offs in June, and 7,556 in April and May. Some of those commercial accounts probably received shut-off notices, but the department's contractor couldn't shut them off, so the DWSD had to make arrangements for its own employees to cut off service.

The DWSD has also been criticized for not shutting off water for large entities like Ford Field, the Detroit Lions, and Olympia Entertainment, which operates Joe Louis Arena. The water department's shut-off campaign has drawn international attention, with activists claiming the operators of Joe Louis are let off the hook despite outstanding water bills. The DWSD says the shutoffs happened in past years, but the collection efforts intensified this year because the delinquent debt in Detroit forces higher rates for the city's paying customers.

The maps sample the evolution of sublimation from the north polar cap, revealing that the released water has a representative D/H value enriched by a factor of about 7 relative to Earth’s ocean (VSMOW). Certain basins and orographic depressions show even higher enrichment, while high altitude regions show much lower values (1 to 3 VSMOW). Our atmospheric maps indicate that water ice in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium to at least 8 VSMOW, which would mean that early Mars (4.5 billion years ago) had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep.\n\nPassage 2:\n\nA massive ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of Mars making the planet a more promising place for alien life to have gained a foothold, Nasa scientists say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The huge body of water spread over a fifth of the planet’s surface, as great a portion as the Atlantic covers the Earth, and was a mile deep in places. In total, the ocean held 20 million cubic kilometres of water, or more than is found in the Arctic Ocean, the researchers found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unveiled by Nasa on Thursday, the compelling evidence for the primitive ocean adds to an emerging picture of Mars as a warm and wet world in its youth, which trickled with streams, winding river deltas, and long-standing lakes, soon after it formed 4.5bn years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The view of the planet’s ancient history radically re-writes what many scientists believed only a decade ago. Back then, flowing water was widely considered to have been a more erratic presence on Mars, gushing forth only rarely, and never forming long-standing seas", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

The study emerges from a new collaboration, funded by a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, to understand the origin and evolution of the unique vocal organ of birds and the large array of sounds it can produce. Because birds descended from dinosaurs, the research may also shed light on how dinosaurs made sound. \n\nThe research identified 52 out of 208 investigated bird species that use closed-mouth vocalization. Only animals with a relatively large body size (about the size of a dove or larger) use closed-mouth vocalization behavior. The association with large bodies is a matter of physics - the lung pressure required to inflate a cavity depends on the tension in the wall of the cavity, and this tension increases for smaller body sizes. \n\nThe study suggests that closed-mouth vocalization can emerge in diverse archosaur species depending on behavioral or environmental circumstances. Closed-mouth vocalization has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs and crocodiles. The occurrence of closed-mouth vocalization across birds and crocodiles indicates that it can emerge in diverse archosaur species.\n\nThe study offers clues that extinct early avian species, and perhaps their dinosaur ancestors, produced booming, closed-mouth sounds.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

And yet unlike many of his contemporaries, Williams had a particular impact on the slice of the population now in our mid-to-late 20s and early 30s. Through the 1990s, Williams, an established film star, shifted into a new gear in his career; he generously and humbly took on entertainment for kids.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Williams' filmography in the 1980s and early 1990s is full of prestige projects (\"Good Morning, Vietnam,\" \"Awakenings,\" \"Dead Poets Society\"), but something shifted with \"Hook\"; the movie about Peter Pan rediscovering the joy of Neverland had the same effect, perhaps, on Williams, who'd always been wacky and loose on-screen but was suddenly acting like he'd never grown up. It took a fairly humble A-lister to play a supporting role in an animated film at a time when voice acting was an anonymous profession, and a fairly brave comic known for working blue to abandon anything that wasn't safe for young children.
