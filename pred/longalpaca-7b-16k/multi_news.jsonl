Researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine found that exposure to cigarette smoke extract made MRSA bacteria harder to kill by macrophages, as well as more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and better at invading human cells. The study suggests that cigarette smoke alters MRSA's cell walls to repel common forms of immune responses.

The species, Caihong juji, lived 160 million years ago and had iridescent feathers on its head and chest, similar to those of hummingbirds. The feathers were well-preserved in fossilized form and contained traces of pigment. Scientists analyzed the structure of the melanosomes and found that they were long, flat and organized into sheets, similar to those in hummingbirds. This suggests that Caihong had a rainbow-colored glimmer. The discovery of iridescent feathers on a non-avian theropod suggests that feathers originally evolved for display, before taking on traits needed for flight. The findings also indicate that feathers may have been used for social or sexual display. Caihong had a bird-like body and crested head, but its long, stiff tail feathers were asymmetrical and likely helped with aerodynamics during flight. The discovery provides new insights into the evolution of feathers and plumage in dinosaurs and birds.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

According to the author, Dan Hooper, harvesting energy from distant stars isn't just a means of increasing resources but also a way to prevent the universe from leaving civilizations behind. With the expansion of the universe accelerating due to dark energy, stars beyond our Local Group will become inaccessible over time. Any civilization determined to maximize energy will expand to harvest stars from other galaxies before they become unobservable, according to Hooper. This could involve throwing a giant net around the star, or using the star's energy to accelerate the whole ball of fire back towards the planet. Some scientists think there may be civilizations thousands or millions of years older than humans who have already harvested stars, and astronomers could detect unusual light signatures from galaxies with harvested stars. Meanwhile, science fiction authors have proposed structures like Dyson spheres to harness energy from stars, which could be detected by waste heat. These structures may be recognized by infrared radiation. The original model of galactic expansion has three types, with humans currently at Type I, harnessing planetary resources. However, humans may eventually reach Type II, harnessing starlight, and eventually Type III, harnessing galaxy resources.\n\n", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "\n\nScientists have made new discoveries about early human toolmaking in Africa. They found that some of the oldest known stone tools were made in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin around 320,000 years ago, much earlier than previously thought. The tools were made of obsidian, which came from far away, indicating long-distance trading networks. This suggests that early humans were able to adapt to changing environments by partnering up with neighboring communities and exchanging resources. The findings fit with genetic evidence that modern humans evolved in Africa between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago. The new discoveries also show that early humans were able to make more specialized, smaller tools, indicating advanced thinking and planning. The diversity of stone tools suggests that early humans were able to produce more sophisticated technologies. The exotic materials found at the sites, such as obsidian and pigment, suggest that early humans had complex social networks and were able to exchange resources over long distances.\n\nThe discoveries challenge the idea that modern human behaviors only emerged outside of Africa. Evidence of modern behaviors, such as symbolism and innovation, has been found in African sites dating back 80,000 years. The new evidence suggests that early humans were able to develop complex behaviors and technologies in response to environmental changes, long before modern humans evolved.\n\nIn summary, the discoveries show that early humans in Africa were able to adapt to changing environments and develop complex technologies and social networks, laying the groundwork for modern human behavior.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements.

{"pred": "\n\nA recent study has found that Mars had an ocean that covered nearly half of its surface at some point in its past. The study analyzed the water vapor in the Martian atmosphere to determine the chemical composition of the water, finding that it contained more deuterium than Earth, indicating that Mars had a significant loss of water. The team used the Keck II telescope and Nasa's Infrared Telescope Facility, along with the ESO's Very Large Telescope, to make maps of the Martian atmosphere over six years. They found that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium, indicating that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past. The amount of water lost was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars, equivalent to 20 million cubic kilometers, or more than the Arctic Ocean. However, the water likely pooled in the northern plains, creating a deeper ocean. The study suggests that Mars was once a warm and wet world, with flowing water and long-standing bodies of water, and provides evidence that Mars may have been habitable in the distant past. The discovery of an ocean on Mars adds to the growing evidence that life may have existed on the planet. NASA's Curiosity rover has already shown that Mars had standing water for 1.5 billion years, and the recent finding of methane in the Martian atmosphere sparks speculation that life may still exist there.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states.

The movie's con is that it shows us a secret underworld, something real that we've never seen or imagined, but it's not doing any of those things. It's ridiculous in every detail and teaches nothing and shows nothing. It's a movie with no truth, that has only its audacity to recommend it. Focus is a movie about Will Smith's jaded charm and how Margot Robbie looks different with her hair up than down. Think of it as scenes disconnected from other scenes, which are amusing for their own sake but have little to do with each other. One scene in particular captures the strengths and weaknesses of Focus. The movie is absurd and groan-out-loud ludicrous. The first hint that the movie is just plain silly is Margot Robbie's audition scene, in which she picks about a dozen wallets and assorted jewelry in a series of intricately choreographed moves involving multiple accomplices. The second hint comes when we see Nicky's operation, a massive warehouse where wallets and jewelry are coming in from multiple sources. However, the nature of Nicky's business remains vague and seems to be whatever the script wants it to be at any given moment. There are some scattered good moments, like the disconcerting sound of race cars whizzing by outside. Despite the good moments, the emotional core of the movie, the relationship between Nicky and Jess, lacks impact because you can't believe a word that they say. Will Smith is not a strong leading man. He plays romance as cool and withdrawn and serious, which means the eclipse of the thing that made him a movie star in the first place, his personality. The casting of Will Smith and Margot Robbie as the leads was a tense drama in Hollywood, with many actresses initially being considered for the role before they settled on the 46-year-old actor and 24-year-old blonde.

The report also accuses Clinton of falsely blaming the violence on the video behind unrest elsewhere. The committee's findings contradict the public statements made by Clinton and other officials at the time of the attack. The report was released after two years and $7 million in taxpayer funds, and Democrats on the committee released their own rebuttal to the GOP's report. The investigation has been described as one of the saddest exercises in Congress by the panel's ranking Democrat, Elijah Cummings. Republicans have been criticized for hiding the report from Democrats and preventing them from accessing transcripts and exculpatory evidence.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked. Zeroing in on what it calls the \"most revealing paragraph\" in the report, Vox concludes there's a pattern of spinning \"non-damning facts as damning\" for the Obama administration. The paragraph in question admits there were no US forces close enough to prevent the attack but insists that, in itself, was a failure on the part of the White House. \"I think it's time to move on,\" the AP quotes Clinton as saying after the release of the report, which she says includes nothing not previously discovered by an accountability board."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3608}

{"pred": "\nA car was suspended from a telephone wire in Mendon, New York on Wednesday evening after the driver reacted too quickly to a GPS unit's instructions to turn around. The car, driven by Nabila Altahan, was westbound on Route 4 when a GPS device gave sudden directions to turn around. Altahan reacted quickly and left the road, causing the car to end up suspended on a guy wire. The driver and passenger were not injured in the incident. Witnesses reported seeing the driver jump out of the car as it was suspended. State police and the Rutland City Fire Department responded to the scene. This accident highlights the potential dangers of relying too heavily on GPS systems, as they can sometimes give sudden and unexpected instructions that can cause accidents.\n\n\n\nPassage 2:\nThe car, a Toyota Corolla, was recovered from the guy wire and towed away. Altahan was ticketed for failing to maintain her lane and unsafe operation of a motor vehicle. She also received a citation for failure to obey a traffic control device.\n\n\nPassage 3:\nThe GPS system in question is a Garmin Nuvi 2685W. Garmin officials have released a statement saying that the device is designed to give drivers turn-by-turn directions and does not have the capability to cause vehicles to leave the road. Garmin officials said the incident was likely caused by user error, and that the device did nothing wrong.\n\n\nPassage 4:\nThe driver, Nabila Altahan, was released on her own recognizance and is scheduled to appear in Mendon Town Court on a later date to answer charges.\n\n\nPassage 5:\nThe accident happened near Sugar & Spice Restaurant on Wednesday evening around 8 p.m. The car was suspended from a guy wire across from the restaurant.\n\n\nPassage 6: The driver of the car, Nabila Altahan, is from Rutland, Vermont.\n\n\n", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP.
