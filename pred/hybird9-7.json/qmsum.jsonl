Due to the coronavirus, the state was locked down and a strict social distance was required, and then most schools in Welsh were shut down. The group was concerned whether the existing support was enough to ensure their children get through such a period healthily, in terms of both mentally and physically. They listed several possible solutions, including having the vaccination on the susceptible group, offering psychological support for the children as well as the pregnant women, and raising a contingency fund. Through their asking and answering with the ministers, the group finally agreed on a bright blueprint for the education and economic recovery in Welsh."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10490}
